## User Context
- **Name**: Dragos
- **Role**: Content creator
- **Website**: bitdoze.com
- **YouTube**: WebDoze channel
- **Timezone**: Bucharest (EET/EEST)

## Session Summary

### Initial Interactions
- User asked to "check db" - ran `.tables` on data/bitdoze.db
- Greetings exchanged, date/time provided
- User asked about workspace folders/files - listed recursively
- Asked how I am - friendly exchange

### Memory Explanation
- User asked "do you have any memory?"
- Explained memory system: daily logs (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md), long-term MEMORY.md, database, chat history
- Auto-load mechanism: USER.md + today/yesterday memory + long-term memory each session
- Emphasized writing to files for persistence

### Main Task: YouTube Script for AI Agent Article
- Request: "I want to create a script to make a youtube codeo for https://www.bitdoze.com/create-your-own-ai-agent/ please help me"
- Attempted to read the URL directly - encountered numpy import error
- Alternative: web search for "create your own AI agent tutorial guide" (5 results)
- Created comprehensive YouTube script proposal titled: "Build Your Own AI Agent From Scratch - Complete Tutorial"
  - Video type: CodeIO/Tutorial (15-20 min)
  - Target: Developers, tech enthusiasts
  - Tone: Friendly, energetic, technical but accessible
  - Structure with timestamped sections (INTRO through OUTRO)
  - Complete code examples for:
    - SimpleAgent (basic OpenAI wrapper)
    - EnhancedAgent with tool calling
    - ConversationalAgent with memory
    - ReActAgent implementation
    - FullAgent with multiple tools
  - Production notes included
- Proposed output files: youtube-script.md, scene-breakdown.md, code-examples/ folder, assets/

### Current Action
- User requested: "dump the context into memory"
- Writing this log to capture conversation and decisions

## Important Decisions/Notes
- YouTube script design uses progressive complexity: start simple, add features step-by-step
- ReAct pattern highlighted as advanced but valuable
- Recommended frameworks for production: LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen
- Script includes practical demonstration: time calculation + file output
- Call to action and GitHub code link planned

## Follow-ups
- Confirm if user wants the script files organized and created
- Possibly need to handle numpy dependency if article reading becomes necessary later
