# Team Workspace

Shared workspace for architect and software-engineer collaboration.

## Shared Paths
- `workspace/team/specs/` for architecture/specification docs.
- `workspace/team/handoffs/` for implementation handoffs.

## Contract
- Architect writes/updates specs and references spec file names in task notes.
- Software engineer reads specs before implementation and writes handoff notes after implementation.
